# TDDE16_Text_Mining
### General 
This is a student assignment for the course Text Mining at Link√∂ping University.

Each file is named after a respective model in the report and work independently.

The end result for each model (the selection of ROUGE scores discussed in the report) are saved in a csv file with the smae name as the modal.

### Setup
Only one setup is required, and that is to apply for permission for and download the newsroom dataset used in the report at https://lil.nlp.cornell.edu/newsroom/. After that is done, clone the repo to your local environment and unzip the newsroom .tar file in the project folder. The models use the file path "newsroom-release/release/dev.jsonl.gz" to access the data.
